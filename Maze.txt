DESCRIPTION
-----------
This may aid your understanding of PMMAZE.  Unfortunately, use
of an explicit stack instead of recursion results in somewhat obscure
code.  Good luck!

To create a maze, use walls to divide a pile of
clay into rectangular rooms of equal size.  Enter
the some room and remove the clay from it.  Randomly
pick an adjacent room that still has clay in it.  If
no such room exists, return to the room emptied just
before the current room was emptied and try again.
If you find an adjacent room containing clay, knock
down the wall separating you from it, enter it, and
remove the clay from it. Keep doing this until you
have returned to the first room to have been emptied
and can find no adjacent room containing clay.
Knock down the walls blocking the entrance and exit
to the maze; the maze is complete!

To solve a maze, start at the entrance (lower
left-hand room).  Use chalk to draw a line on the
floor from the middle of the room to the outside of
the maze.  In a given room, find a direction out of
the room that you have not yet taken and that does
not follow your chalk line.  If such a direction
exists, extend the chalk line in that direction
until you reach the middle of an adjacent room.  If
no such direction exists, follow the chalk line out
of the room, erasing it until you reach the middle
of an adjacent room.  Since the maze generated by
this program has exactly one solution that does not
involve backtracking, you will eventually reach the
exit (upper right-hand room).

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK

3) Run "nmake" or "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.


TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- wrc 		- Version 2.0beta1
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing make on the directory, but a compile.cmd file is includes to store the log in a file. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
